								<h2>Character üîÆ </h2>
								<p>Hi there! I‚Äôm Irdina Hannah Binti Misnun, but you can call me Dina. I‚Äôm a passionate and curious adventurer in the world of computer science, programming, and problem-solving. Whether it‚Äôs building communities or exploring uncharted territories, I‚Äôm all about embracing challenges and creating meaningful impact.

									Outside the digital realm, I‚Äôm a hands-on creator who loves arts and crafts, a playlist enthusiast constantly discovering new tunes, and an outdoor explorer with a love for badminton and spontaneous hangouts with friends. My friends often say I‚Äôm the ‚Äúgo-to motivator,‚Äù blending creativity, quirkiness, and a knack for inspiring others.
									
									Let‚Äôs connect and make something amazing happen!</p>
								<h2>Background üß∏</h2>
								<p>As the eldest daughter in my family, I‚Äôve always embraced the responsibility of being a role model and paving the way for my siblings. From academics to life experiences, I‚Äôve often found myself at the forefront, navigating uncharted territory with determination and resilience.

									Being the first in my family to pursue higher education and take on new opportunities has been both a privilege and a challenge. I‚Äôve learned to balance the expectations placed on me with my own aspirations, all while guiding my family through the "trial-and-error" moments that come with new experiences.
									
									This journey has taught me the value of perseverance, adaptability, and the importance of creating a supportive path for those who follow. It has shaped my character, driven my ambition, and strengthened my commitment to making a meaningful difference not just for myself, but for my family and beyond.</p>
								<h2>Fun Fact üíú</h2>
								<p>Some fun facts about me: I can‚Äôt sleep with the lights on, I have a quirky hobby of collecting my friends‚Äô funny pictures, and I absolutely love polaroids and photostrips! I also enjoy creating memory boxes filled with meaningful treasures like tickets, photos, cards, stickers, and other sentimental items. Oh, and I have an undeniable sweet tooth‚ÄîI‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with desserts! </p>
